Test::Base::Filter
==================

Default Filter Class for Test::Base

= Synopsis

    package MyTestSuite;
    use Test::Base -Base;

    ... reusable testing code ...

    package MyTestSuite::Filter;
    use Test::Base::Filter -Base;

    sub my_filter1 {
        ...
    }

= Description

Filters are the key to writing effective data driven tests with Test::Base.
Test::Base::Filter is a class containing a large default set of generic
filters. You can easily subclass it to add/override functionality.

= Filters

This is a list of the default stock filters (in alphabetic order):

- `append`

  list => list

  Append a string to each element of a list.

    --- numbers lines chomp append=-#\n join
    one
    two
    three

- `array`

  list => scalar

  Turn a list of values into an anonymous array reference.

- `base64_decode`

  scalar => scalar

  Decode base64 data. Useful for binary tests.

- `base64_encode`

  scalar => scalar

  Encode base64 data. Useful for binary tests.

- `chomp`

  list => list

  Remove the final newline from each string value in a list.

- `chop`

list => list

  Remove the final char from each string value in a list.

- `dumper`

  scalar => list

  Take a data structure (presumably from another filter like eval) and use
  Data::Dumper to dump it in a canonical fashion.

- `escape`

  scalar => scalar

  Unescape all backslash escaped chars.

- `eval`

  scalar => list

  Run Perl's `eval` command against the data and use the returned value as the
  data.

- `eval_all`

  scalar => list

  Run Perl's `eval` command against the data and return a list of 4 values:

    1) The return value
    2) The error in $@
    3) Captured STDOUT
    4) Captured STDERR

- `eval_stderr`

  scalar => scalar

  Run Perl's `eval` command against the data and return the captured STDERR.

- `eval_stdout`

  scalar => scalar

  Run Perl's `eval` command against the data and return the captured STDOUT.

- `exec_perl_stdout`

  list => scalar

  Input Perl code is written to a temp file and run. STDOUT is captured and
  returned.

- `flatten`

  scalar => list

  Takes a hash or array ref and flattens it to a list.

- `get_url`

  scalar => scalar

  The text is chomped and considered to be a url. Then LWP::Simple::get is
  used to fetch the contents of the url.

- `hash`

  list => scalar

  Turn a list of key/value pairs into an anonymous hash reference.

- `head[=number]`

  list => list

  Takes a list and returns a number of the elements from the front of it. The
  default number is one.

- `join`

  list => scalar

  Join a list of strings into a scalar.

- `Join`

  Join the list of strings inside a list of array refs and return the strings
  in place of the array refs.

- `lines`

  scalar => list

  Break the data into an anonymous array of lines. Each line (except possibly
  the last one if the `chomp` filter came first) will have a newline at the
  end.

- `norm`

  scalar => scalar

  Normalize the data. Change non-Unix line endings to Unix line endings.

- `prepend=string`

  list => list

  Prepend a string onto each of a list of strings.

- `read_file`

  scalar => scalar

  Read the file named by the current content and return the file's content.

- `regexp[=xism]`

  scalar => scalar

  The `regexp` filter will turn your data section into a regular expression
  object. You can pass in extra flags after an equals sign.

  If the text contains more than one line and no flags are specified, then the
  'xism' flags are assumed.

- `reverse`

  list => list

  Reverse the elements of a list.

- `Reverse`

  list => list

  Reverse the list of strings inside a list of array refs.

- `slice=x[,y]`

  list => list

  Returns the element number x through element number y of a list.

- `sort`

  list => list

  Sorts the elements of a list in character sort order.

- `Sort`

  list => list

  Sort the list of strings inside a list of array refs.

- `split[=string|pattern]`

  scalar => list

  Split a string in into a list. Takes a optional string or regexp as a
  parameter. Defaults to /\s+/. Same as Perl `split`.

- `Split[=string|pattern]`

  list => list

  Split each of a list of strings and turn them into array refs.

- `strict`

  scalar => scalar

  Prepend the string:

    use strict;
    use warnings;

  to the block's text.

- `tail[=number]`

  list => list

  Return a number of elements from the end of a list. The default number is
  one.

- `trim`

  list => list

  Remove extra blank lines from the beginning and end of the data. This allows
  you to visually separate your test data with blank lines.

- `unchomp`

  list => list

  Add a newline to each string value in a list.

- `write_file[=filename]`

  scalar => scalar

  Write the content of the section to the named file. Return the filename.

- `yaml`

  scalar => list

  Apply the YAML::Load function to the data block and use the resultant
  structure. Requires YAML.pm.
